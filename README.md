# RazorRenderer

This is a port of the [RenderViewToString](https://github.com/aspnet/Entropy/tree/master/samples/Mvc.RenderViewToString) sample from Microsoft's [Entropy repo](https://github.com/aspnet/Entropy) from ASP.NET Core 2.2 to 5.0.
You can adapt it to add stand-alone Razor view rendering to console or other project types.
